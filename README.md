#Short Answer Questions

1. What is the need (i.e. challenge) that you will be addressing in your project?

@HOMEGROWN-LOCAL promotes diversity, quality and uniqueness. We are giving consumer ability to choose to have their fruits and vegetable demand being met by their local growers. The supply hopefully will bring back the quality of our fruits and vegetable supplies because products are being harvested while ripe and time travel to consumer plate is reduced being local. Unlike fruits from a commercial food distributor, our fruits and vegetable will focus on quality not looks, apples might not look perfect but they taste good and super fresh. @HOMEGROWN-LOCAL will also be bringing the profits back to the grower by cut short the distribution chain. 


2. Identify the problem you’re trying to solve by building this particular marketplace App? Why is it a problem that needs solving?

At the moment, our commercial food chain fruits being harvested while firm in order for them to still stay edible when reaching the consumer. The fruits and vegetable taste bland because they were not let to ripe on the tree. 
Homegrown local will also try to promote edible urban landscape. In the old days. it is common for each household to grow some of their produce in their backyard. Apart from local Sunday market, we enable network of direct fresh produce to be sold whenever they are ready without waiting for Sunday market to happen. 

The demand of organic food is increasing throughout the years. Organic food is known to be healthier because of the absence of chemicals that are normally used in the cultivation process, but because of the complication that came without using the chemicals, which means higher cultivation risk for the farmer and higher returns are expected out of organic food. On top of that, involvement of middle party between farmer and consumer increases the price of the food even further.

3. Describe the project will you be conducting and how. your App will address the needs.

HomeGrownLocal is an web application that directly connects farmer with consumer. Our application also happens to be a two sided marketplace, therefore the consumer are allowed to participate as a seller if the consumer happened to have a small garden or a vacant field.

4. Describe the network infrastructure the App may be based on.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Our application is deployed through the Platform as a Service (PAAS) Heroku, a popular software product that allows developers to push code directly from GitHub to the internet via Heroku's deployment platfrom and network infrastructure.

Heroku can be accessed either directly from GitHub or through the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI), and allows developers to spin up an application quickly and for free without needing to purchase their own servers or deploy their own database / network infrastructure.

Our app is deployed through the following process:

DEVELOPMENT PHASE
Ruby on Rails is a popular web framework written in Ruby.
Codes are written using Ruby on Rails application and deployment for local testing enabled using with inbuilt Rails Server hosting it at a localhost port). For Version Control we manage our source code using Github repositories. Each programmer needs to download a version from origin each time before starting daily coding. Pull request generated and merge with a local master. 
Our database is using PostgreSQL.


DEPLOYMENT / EXECUTION PHASE

Heroku integrates with GitHub to make it easy to deploy code living on GitHub to apps running on Heroku. When GitHub integration is configured for a Heroku app, Heroku can automatically build and release (if the build is successful) pushes to the specified GitHub repo.

We integrate our Github repositories with Heroku application deployment (To configure GitHub integration, you have to authenticate with GitHub. You only have to do this once per Heroku account). We use the Heroku dashboard to configure Github integration.

Heroku is is a free Cloud-based platform to build and deploy internet application. 
Deployment is performed directly from GitHub via Heroku's deployment platform. Heroku can be accessed either directly from GitHub or through the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI). 

The Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI) makes it easy to create and manage your Heroku apps directly from the terminal

5. Identify and describe the software to be used in your App.

Software Languages:

Front-end:
HTML: HyperText Markup Language. A language used to constract web pages. Used mostly for structure, capable of basic styling for elements.
ERB: Embedded Ruby. ERB enables ruby logic to be implemented directly in an HTML page and read by the browser as HTML. 
CSS: Cascading Style Sheets. CSS sheets are attached to an HTML page to style the web-page. Mostly styles are static elements, though can be used to create minimal animations.
Sass: Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets. Adds some additional features to CSS while also able to be written as standard CSS. Additional features include, variables, nested elements (for cleaner organisation and grouping of elements), mixins (methods)

Back-end:
Ruby: 
Ruby on Rails: Web application framework written in Ruby. Used to create full-stack web applications. MVC (Model Controller View) framework using separation of concerns. Emphasises CoC 'Convention Over Configuration', in other words is meant to be able to be used out of the box with conventions specific to RoR, and a large degree of abstraction to automate many technical or time-consuming aspects of building a web application, like spawning databases and writing database migrations, creating controllers, views, routes, and handling different types of HTTP requests.

Database Software:

PostgreSQL Database: A popular Relational Database Management System based on the SQL Database Language. Data is strutured in a way that allows for queries based on data objects and their relationships with each other, written natively or through an ORM.
ActiveRecord: An ORM 'Object Relational Mapping' tool. Abstracts SQL query language so that code can be written in another language like Ruby, and used to speak to the database and request information.
Rake: Software Task Management and Build Automation tool written in Ruby. Can be used to define various tasks used in configuring software build, file compilation, database creation and management.

Version Control:

Git and GitHub: Source Control software. Open-sourced popular software development tool that allows for either single programmerse to work on their local machine, or remote teams to work together on a project using the GitHub Web Application connected to a local CLI Command Line Interface. Most popular features are the ability to 'commit', or save a piece of software at a certain 'state', which can be returned to at a later date. Also allows asynchronous development of applications and features using 'branches' of software that are written concorrently but don't affect the core branch unless merged at a later time.

Deployment:

Heroku

<<< popular Platform as a Service (PAAS) product that allows for deployment of web applications without owning your own database or server infrastructure. Users can push code in many different languages directly from GitHub to the internet via Heroku's deployment platfrom where it handles building and deployment of the application>>.

6. Identify the database to be used in your App and provide a justification for your choice.

Heroku works smoothly with Postgresql and Ruby on Rails.

PostgreSQL is a relational database, making it easy to manipulate and access data.

Postgresql syntax is based on SQL and popular hence plenty of documentation available on the internet. 

- PostgreSQL, because we are using Heroku as our deployment option and Heroku has a dependency on PostgreSQL

7. Identify and describe the production database setup (i.e. postgres instance).

rails new -d postgresql
It will create a local instance of PostgreSQL database on rails using Ruby on Rails. 

rails db:create
It will create our database

rails g scaffold (Model) or rails g model (Model)
It will create schema for our tables

rails db migrate 
It will create relevant tables from our schema

This postgresSQL database will become our Development and Testing database 

rails db:seed
It will seed our database with fake data we put on seeds.rb file
 
####### Chris - can you comment on these answers as I did not actually do this part ######
<We initially created an local instance of a PostgreSQL database using Ruby on Rails by calling the flag -d postgresql when creating the Rails app. We then call 'rails db:create' and set up our tables and columns using migrations: eg 'rails g model user' & 'rails g migration AddNameToUser'. This database then becomes our Development and testing database which we seed with fake data using the seeds.rb file.>

<For Production, the Migrations and Schema of our Development Database are pushed to Heroku from the GitHub repository, then set up within Heroku. To do this we run the same commands to create the database and run migrations, only we put 'heroku run' before the command.

Because the schema and migrations are the same, the structure of our database on Heroku is exactly the same and can be seeded using the same seeds.rb file.

Therefore our production database is an instance of a postgres database, hosted on Heroku, because the schema and migrations are the same, the structure of database on Heroku is exactly the same and can be seeded using the same seed.rb file

8. Describe the architecture of your App.



CLIENT/WEB
Displays the web page in a web browser
Handles User Interface and user interactions with the web page.
Sends and receives HTTP requests to and from the web server by interacting with the web page.

WEB SERVER
Processes HTTP requests and directs the request to the requested Route.

ROUTES
A map of pathways defined by the application that define which functions are called in the controller depending on different requests from the server

Most common HTTP requests are:
GET (request information from the database)
DELETE (delete information in the database)
POST (send new information to the database)
PATCH / UPDATE (update / change existing information in the database)

CONTROLLER
The location of the logic of the application. Contains functions that are called by requests from the web server
Functions either:
query information from the database
request files required to load a certain web page, or 'view'
call information from external APIs or other web services
parses or formats ready to be used in some following function or view
run other types of logic specific to the application
Tells the web server how to display web pages with information received from the Database or

VIEWS
The final representation of the initial request from the client.
Tells the browser what to display to the user. Can be in many different formats, including HTML & CSS, JSON, Images, Pdf etc

ORM
Parses code from the controller to native SQL language.
Allows the appliation to set and retrieve properties and relationships of database models (data)

DATABASE
PostgreSQL relational database that stores persistent information used by the application.


9. Explain the different high-level components (abstractions) in your App.

Ruby on Rails as our web application framework 
Ruby on Rails is a MVC framework.

Model (M)
Model represents shape of the data and business logic. It maintains the data of the application. Model objects retrieve and store model state in a database.

Model (M) Defines the structure of the data held in our database, including attributes of objects, logic (functions) used to manipulate that data at the database level, dependencies / validations, and the relationships between different objects. Files are located in app/models directory

View (V) Uses HTML and Embedded Ruby to describe how the pages of the application appear within a browser. Files are located in app/views, and styled with Sass CSS files located in app/assets directories.

Controller (C) Sits between the Models, Views, and any APIs and controls their function. Controller methods can be called via RESTful API routes, which are in turn triggered by HTTP requests from the Client, or in some cases can be called by changes in the state of the data in the databse. Controller files are located in app/controllers directory.

Browser sends request to the MVC application
Incoming request directed to controller
Controller processes request and forms a data model
This model is passed to the appropriate view
The views renders the output




Active Record

A layer of abstraction that sits between our application and the database. Active record abstracts SQL code so that we can talk to the database using Ruby, and allows us to tread the data in the Model as Ruby objects.

Other

Some additional abstractions provided by Rails commonly used in our application:

Active Storage: Allows us to upload images through forms, and forms a helpful layer we can use to speak to the AWS S3 API for image hosting
Form helpers: For easy forms that abstract the HTML
link_to / redirect_to: For easy access and alias calling of RESTful routes

10. Detail any third party services that your App will use.

- Stripe

- AWS S3

- Geolocator

11. Describe (in general terms) the data structure of marketplace apps that are similar to your own (e.g. eBay, Airbnb).

GUMTREE
Users will have many items
Each user can be both seller and buyer
Items can have zero to many reviews

17. Describe the way tasks are allocated and tracked in your project.

- Both tasks allocation and tracking are achieved through Kanban board, there are few layers of stages in our Kanban board.

18. Discuss how Agile methodology is being implemented in your project.

- We conducted a daily stand-up meeting on daily basis to promote open communication between team members.

- We initially prioritize on our MVP (Minimum Viable Product) rather than having sophisticated unfinished product.

- We constantly communicate with our instructor to ensure that our product doesn't get sidetracked and properly fulfilled our requirements.

- We are using Kanban board via Trello. Tasks assignment and re-prioritization is achievable because of this tool.
