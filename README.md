# Section 2: Planning And Project Management

## Idea Conception

![]( "Brainstorming Idea Image")

Coming up with the idea was a very collaborative process. We all brainstormed ideas on individually for a set period of time and listed them all together.

### Sprint Meetings & Stand Ups

With a project timeline of 3 weeks we conducted sprint meetings at the start of each week. The sprint meetings were used a tool to ensure team members were all on the same page and from an overview perspective we were heading in the right direction and on track. The following is what was covered in the sprint meetings:

* Evaluation of what needs to be done
* Evaluation of how we are going
* Discuss any pivoting that needs to be done or any blocker we had or may come up in the following week

Stand ups were done a on a daily basis first thing in the morning as tool for communication between the team. The below
